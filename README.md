# Spatial-database-for-fire-department
The project aimed to develop a geographical information system GIS. It helps users in emergency call center to locate the on-fire building on the map and then finding the nearest hydrant and fire station. It also finds shortest path with lowest cost, based on travelling distance, from both hydrant and fire station to the on fire building; also it considers blocked streets if any. Moreover, the application is able to provide statistical information about fires that happened in a specific region on specific time period, include number of times a building was on fire and which station dispatched to rescue. Additionally, by clicking on each building fire fighters can find out about the number of floors and residents in the building, so they can make more precise decision about the number of vehicles, and rescuers that must be dispatched to the location.
